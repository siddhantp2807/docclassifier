1,"Lord Callaghan, the former Prime Minister of Britain, has passed away at the age of 92, just 11 days after his wife Audrey died aged 91. Lord Callaghan was the longest living former British PM in history and is survived by his son and two daughters. He held various prominent positions throughout his career, including that of chancellor, home secretary, foreign secretary and prime minister. Lord Callaghan of Cardiff was also a committed public servant who entered parliament in 1945 when he was elected for a Cardiff constituency. His political career was not without controversy, however, and included conflicts with the hard left of the party and disagreements over policies such as the Common Market and the country's entry. Despite this, Lord Callaghan was remembered with fondness by politicians of all parties following his passing.",
2,"A Conservative election candidate named Danny Kruger is resigning after making a statement that he wanted a ""period of creative destruction in the public services."" Kruger had been scheduled to run against Tony Blair in Sedgefield. The Conservative Party claims Kruger's statement was taken out of context and that he supports their policies on public services. However, Kruger has decided not to contest the election in fear of damaging the Conservative Party's reputation. Kruger will remain in his job at the Tory campaign headquarters. The Labour Party has accused Kruger of exposing the Conservative agenda for cutting £35bn from public services.",
3,"Military leaders are set to meet and make a final decision about the future of Scotland's Army regiments. There are plans to restructure the regiments by cutting the six single-battalion regiments to five and merging them into a super regiment. These plans have faced opposition from campaigners and politicians alike. The decision made by the committee of senior defence figures must be ratified by the Defence Secretary and the Prime Minister. The proposed changes have sparked an outcry from Labour backbenchers, opposition politicians, and campaigners who threatened to stand against Labour in the next general election. There are concerns that the proposed restructuring will lead to recruitment problems and a loss of local connections and heritage. An alternative blueprint had been put forward, which proposed going ahead with the merger while preserving the other regiments. It seems unlikely that the Prime Minister will consider this plan, as he has hinted that a super regiment is likely. The government's aim is to preserve tradition while introducing a more effective structure.",
4,"The play ""The History Boys"" by Alan Bennett won two awards at the Critics' Circle Theatre Awards, with Richard Griffiths winning best actor for his role as teacher Hector.

5,"Tony Blair has supported the pre-Budget report by Chancellor Gordon Brown, despite opposition claims that he was too optimistic about the UK economy. Blair stated that the report highlights stability and opportunity, which are central to Labour's next election campaign. Brown denied that his economic forecasts were overly optimistic, but did not rule out future tax rises. Blair praised Brown for creating economic stability, which is the cornerstone of Labour's programme. The report predicts UK growth between 3% and 3.5%, which many experts believe to be too optimistic, leading to fears of tax rises or spending cuts. Conservative Shadow Chancellor Oliver Letwin accused Brown of using ""fancy statistics"" to hide public service failures, while Vincent Cable of the Liberal Democrats called for the government's books to be opened up to the National Audit Office to check if Brown had met his ""golden rule.""",
6,"Andre Agassi withdrew from the Kooyong Classic due to a hip injury, putting his participation in the Australian Open in doubt. He stopped the match against fellow American Andy Roddick at a score of 5-6 down in the first set due to his hip cramping. Agassi, who has previously won the Australian Open four times, will undergo an MRI scan to determine the degree of his injury. He mentioned that the hip injury he suffered last year while missing Wimbledon was not the current problem. He expressed concern over his condition and hopes to deal with it effectively. Time will inform whether he will still be able to participate in the Australian Open, and he will have a better sense of his prospects in a few days.",
7,"The president of Sri Lanka has started a rebuilding campaign worth 1.8 billion pounds after the devastation caused by a tsunami. The IMF estimates that the tsunami caused damage equal to 6.5% of the country's economy, and cut one percentage point from Sri Lanka's economic growth for this year. At least one million people lost their jobs in Sri Lanka and Indonesia due to the tsunami and as a result, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) is calling for job creation. The president is appealing for peace and national unity as a means to create a new beginning to rebuild the country with its numerous natural resources. The IMF anticipates that multiple industries including fishing, agriculture, and tourism will experience negative impacts due to the disaster, which could harm Sri Lanka's economic growth, inflation, and balance of payments.

8,"Apple is facing criticism from the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) for attempting to force three American online journalists to disclose their sources for articles containing leaked information about unreleased Apple products, including the Mac Mini and product code-named Asteroid. The EFF argues that the journalists are protected by the American constitution and is representing the reporters in the legal battle against Apple. The case raises questions about the extent to which corporations can prevent information from being published and whether online journalists have the same privileges and protections as those writing for traditional media. The EFF has gained support from high-profile individuals and argues that if Apple succeeds in exposing the sources, it will deter potential confidential sources from providing information to the media, resulting in the public losing a vital outlet for independent news and commentary.",

11,"The movie Ocean's Twelve, a sequel to Ocean's Eleven with George Clooney, Brad Pitt, and Julia Roberts, has become the number one movie in the US box office, earning $40.8m in ticket sales during its opening weekend. The plot follows the master criminals as they plan three major heists across Europe. The film's success makes it the fourth-biggest December release in the US after the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It beat Ocean's Eleven's opening weekend gross of $38.1m and went on to earn $184m in total. Despite mixed reviews, it is considered a fun holiday movie and is directed by Steven Soderbergh, who directed the first movie. Catherine Zeta-Jones joins the cast.",
12,"The Japanese economy grew by only 0.1% in the three months prior to September. This was below expectations and caused concern as Japan's economy had been stagnant for a long period of time. The weak growth can be attributed to faltering exports, subdued domestic demand, and insufficient corporate investment. Japan's economy has become increasingly dependent on exports for recovery, but high oil prices and the falling dollar have affected this. This is a significant downturn from earlier in the year, with the first quarter showing growth of 6.3% and the second quarter showing 1.1%. While personal consumption looks good, it is mainly due to temporary factors such as the Olympics. The government may find it challenging to implement policies such as raising taxes to deal with the public debt when the economy picks up.",
13,"China's economy grew at a higher than expected rate of 9.5% in 2004, which could lead to limits on investment and lending as Beijing works to cool down the economy. While industrial growth has slowed, services have been a driving force behind growth. However, consumer prices rose at a faster rate, causing concern over inflation. China's exports have also surged due to the relatively cheap yuan. Despite calls to change the currency's exchange rate, officials say they are not ready to shift to a more market-driven rate. Overall, the economy remains strong, with no signs of a slowdown in 2005.",
14,"New figures from the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) show that UK consumers are the world's biggest music buyers. However, despite growing sales in DVD music videos, the global sales of recorded music remained flat in 2004 due to online and physical piracy in major markets. The UK music industry saw a 3% growth in volume sales, driven mostly by its strong album market. Despite this, world music sales declined by 1.3% to $33.6 billion (£17.7 billion). The US and UK had the largest number of album releases in 2004. The BPI chairman attributed the overall sales growth to new UK-signed artists, such as Keane, Katie Melua, and Scissor Sisters. Although digital sales in the US were booming, many markets in Continental Europe and Asia were severely affected by internet piracy. The IFPI CEO stated that the priority for the coming year is to increase legitimate digital sales and sustain anti-piracy efforts.",
15,"Sandra, the former model and wife of Conservative party leader Michael Howard, will have a significant role in the party's election campaign. She will be visiting target seats alone and also accompanying her husband on his campaign trail via helicopter. Michael Howard will host a daily news conference at the Conservative party's London headquarters to increase accessibility to the public. This move is in contrast to Tony Blair's campaign strategy, as there are no plans for him to hold daily news conferences. The Liberal Democrats also plan to hold daily news conferences but with their party leader, Charles Kennedy. Sandra Howard has already been campaigning alongside her husband and has also given a speech about drug charities. She will continue to be part of her husband's campaign.",
16,"The term ""blog"" has been named the top word of 2004 by Merriam-Webster, a US dictionary publisher, as it was the most looked-up word on their site during the year. Blogs, or web logs, have become increasingly popular during 2004 and some have even started to influence mainstream media. The Merriam-Webster list also included terms related to major news events such as the US presidential election or natural disasters that hit the US. Blogs come in various forms and are used for different purposes such as news sites, political commentary, and lists of interesting websites. Online journals have become popular due to the easy-to-use software and the number of blogs in existence has doubled every five and a half months for the last 18 months, with over 4.8 million blogs in existence, though less than a quarter of them are regularly maintained. Blogs have become a means for many ordinary workers to share their daily lives, and in repressive regimes and developing nations, they have been used by millions of people to express their struggles.",
17,"The government of Japan has stated that it expects the country's economic growth to slow down to 1.6% in the upcoming fiscal year beginning in April 2005, down from the current rate of 2.1%. However, they claim that they are making progress towards ending deflation, and predict that the economy will grow by 2% in 2006/07. The economics minister, Heizo Takenaka, stated that the consumer price index (CPI) would rise by 0.1% in the next fiscal year, which would be the first increase since 2000/01. Takenaka believes that the government is on the right path towards improving real economic conditions and overcoming deflation. For over five years, Japan has been suffering from deflation, and to combat this issue, the Bank of Japan has been regularly injecting excess cash into the money market to maintain short-term interest rates at 0% and boost economic activity.",
18,"The animated movie Shark Tale, which received an Oscar nomination, has become the top-selling home video in the US following its release on DVD, making $80 million in its first week. The amount of money earned from DVD and video sales far exceeded its first week box office takings, and it has become the sixth highest-earning DVD for first week sales. The movie sold more than six million DVDs and videos across the United States and Canada, and is the highest first-week earner for February, outpacing My Big Fat Greek Wedding. Typically, films that are expected to generate strong home video earnings are released during the busiest retail season, which falls before Christmas. Shrek 2 was the best-selling home video of last year, with North American sales alone estimated at $458 million.",
19,"An American TV network is editing the BBC movie Dirty War to remove a scene that shows a nude woman being washed after a fictional chemical attack to avoid indecency complaints from US TV watchdogs. Many US broadcasters are now cautious about showing such scenes after the US Federal Communications Commission fined CBS $550,000 last fall for a wardrobe malfunction during a dance routine. PBS, which is a non-profit media company, is opting to show the edited version as it is financially safer and could discourage individual stations from broadcasting the film. PBS is considered a trusted community resource in the US, providing programming for almost 100 million viewers each week.",

The initiative is being run by the Hansard Society, the Electoral Commission, and the Department for Education and Skills. The mock elections will take place around the time of the real general election, and schools will receive information packs, including manifesto guides, and ballot papers.",
23,"Campaigners are rallying for the reopening of the Borders rail link, which was shut down in 1969. They plan to have a walk at Tweedbank to commemorate the 36th anniversary of the line closure. The Campaign for Borders Rail believes that the reopening of the Waverley Line will revive the area's economy. Members of the Scottish Parliament are considering reintroducing passenger rail services to the Borders. If the Waverley Line were to reopen, it could cost up to £100m and provide a significant economic boost for the Borders. In 2000, the Borders Council concluded that the area's economy had suffered since the closure. The Campaign for Borders Rail is asking the Scottish Executive to commit to funding the first phase of the project by restoring the line between Edinburgh and Tweedbank. They believe that reopening the line will be a prosperous move that preserves the character of the Scottish Borders. A review in 2000 concluded that a half-hourly service from Tweedbank to Edinburgh could cover its running expenses, as could the service from Gorebridge to Edinburgh. A freight railway linking the West Coast Main Line at Longtown was also found to be restorable.",
24,"Peter Molyneux, who is the head of Surrey's Lionhead Studios, has been awarded the OBE in the New Year Honours list for his contributions to the computer games industry. He is regarded as the mastermind behind many famous games, such as Populous, Theme Park, Dungeon Keeper, and Black and White. His induction into the OBE came as a surprise to him, as he never thought computer gaming would become such a huge industry. Peter Molyneux is recognized as an essential figure in the gaming world for nearly 20 years. In 1987, he started his career at Bullfrog Studios, and it took off from there. He left Bullfrog to set up the Lionhead Studios and was responsible for creating ambitious and highly praised games like Black & White. He still has one problem to solve before picking up his OBE: what to wear.",

Andrew Wilson of Glasgow is out for a month with ligament damage to both knees, while Jason White and Tom Smith have missed practice due to flu. The coach is considering options such as Alasdair Strokosch and Simon Cross from Edinburgh, and Jon Dunbar from Leeds Tykes.",
26,"Federer joins all-time greats The last year has seen one player dominate men's tennis, and one country dominate the women's game. Roger Federer became the first man since Mats Wilander in 1988 to win three Grand Slams in one season. And after Anastasia Myskina became the first Russian woman to win a Grand Slam at the French Open, two more followed at Wimbledon and the US Open. Meanwhile, Briton Tim Henman enjoyed his best year, while Greg Rusedski fought back superbly from adversity. Federer began the year as world number one and holder of the Wimbledon and Masters Cup titles, and set about conquering new ground. The Swiss sounded warning of the dominance to come at the Australian Open. He ripped through the draw before beating Marat Safin in the final. Andy Roddick was the only player to put up any real resistance at Wimbledon, and Federer's performance against Lleyton Hewitt in the US Open final was breathtaking. Federer again got the better of Hewitt in the season-ending Masters Cup. His victory in Houston proved to be his 13th successive win in a final, an Open era record. The only major let-down was a third-round loss to Gustavo Kuerten at the French Open, and Roland Garros will be his main target in 2005. There was also a surprise loss to the unheralded Tomas Berdych at the Olympic Games, which saw Chile dominate as Nicoals Massu took the singles and then paired up with Fernando Gonzaelz to win doubles gold. Another major trophy that looks beyond Federer is the Davis Cup, which was won by Spain in a 3-2 home success over the USA in Seville. Roddick struggled on the clay, losing to Rafael Nadal on the opening day before going down to Carlos Moya in the all-important fourth rubber. Henman broke new ground by reaching the semis on clay at the French Open - a stunning effort - and also at the US Open. A quarter-final defeat to Mario Ancic at Wimbledon was disappointing for the limp manner of the Briton's defeat, but he remains optimistic of going further next year. British number two Rusedski endured a rollercoaster year, returning to the circuit after being cleared of a doping offence in March. With his ranking down at 168, many feared the 31-year-old's career was over, but he battled back in the second half of the season to re-enter the top 50. The Russian women finally delivered on their long-recognised promise in 2004, with Myskina, Maria Sharapova and Svetlana Kuznetsova winning Grand Slams, before taking the season-ending Fed Cup. But while the young Russians were on the way up, it was a different story for the Belgians and the Williams sisters. Only veteran Lindsay Davenport held the new wave at bay, a stunning run of form after Wimbledon taking her to number one ahead of Amelie Mauresmo, whose Grand Slam drought goes on. The year started in regulation fashion as Justine Henin-Hardenne beat compatriot Kim Clijsters at the Australian Open. A virus ruined the rest of Henin-Hardenne's year, although she was fit enough to win Olympic gold, but Clijsters had an even more miserable 2004. She suffered a serious wrist injury and then announced the end of her relationship with Lleyton Hewitt, and will be happy to see the year end. In their absence, Myskina thrashed Elena Dementieva in a historic, but woeful, all-Russian final at the French Open. Wimbledon was a more refreshing affair as Sharapova captivated SW19, showing nerves of steel as she battled past Davenport and Serena Williams to take the title. Davenport was a strong favourite for the US Open but, hampered by injury, lost to the powerful and unflappable Kuznetsova in the semis. Kuznetsova went on to give Dementieva another Grand Slam final thrashing, with the latter's wayward serve becoming one of the talking points of the year. With the Russians still improving, the likes of Henin-Hardenne, Clijsters, Davenport, Mauresmo, Venus and Serena will need to be fully fit and motivated in 2005. And it may take their compatriot Safin to challenge Federer on the men's side.

30,"David Blunkett has unveiled new plans to improve policing in England and Wales. The plans include the creation of a dedicated policing team for each neighborhood, a 10-point customer charter, and a new non-emergency phone number for police calls. Local residents could also be given the mobile phone number of their local police officer, and could ""trigger"" action on specific problems if they felt nothing was being done. Local councillors would need to meet certain conditions before invoking the power, and frivolous complaints would be refused if they caused annoyance or posed too heavy a burden on police resources. Mr. Blunkett also plans to recruit an additional 25,000 Community Support Officers and promised £50m to recruit 2,000 new CSOs. The best-performing police services would receive more funding and extra freedoms, but the home secretary would not hesitate to intervene where the public was being failed. The plans have been criticized by the opposition parties for tying up the police with paperwork and being little more than a ""taxpayer-funded PR exercise,"" but some politicians have praised the government's efforts to increase links between local people and the police.",

32,"The problem of online security fears is affecting the potential of e-commerce as customers are increasingly concerned about cyber attacks such as phishing and identity theft. A recent survey found that almost 70% of respondents did not believe that online companies were doing enough to protect their personal information. This is worrying for businesses and customers who want to use the internet for financial transactions. Although more people are becoming aware of the threat, they have little faith that companies are doing enough to counter it. Experts recommend that both parties need to take responsibility to prevent fraud by ensuring extra security measures are in place. One of the biggest challenges to improving security online is how to authenticate an individual's identity. Passwords are easily compromised, and several security companies have developed alternative methods such as biometric measurement or token-based systems to provide a single online identity. For example, Activcard has developed a one-time passcode generation technology that uses the chip embedded in bank cards and a special card reader to generate unique codes that are active for a specified amount of time. This method is being trialed with UK banks and could be a more secure way to conduct online transactions.",
33,"Labour and the Tories are in a dispute over tax and spending plans, with the argument over Gordon Brown's budget turning into a pre-election battle. Tony Blair accused the Tory government of planning to cut £35bn from public services that will affect schools, hospitals, and police, while the Tories claim that Labour's statements are misrepresentation and smear tactics. The Lib Dems criticized Brown for avoiding the issue of council tax rises. Brown and Blair came together at a Labour poster launch and claimed that the Tories would cut the same amount from public services, which is equal to sacking every doctor and teacher in the UK. The Tories deny the allegations and claim that not a single doctor, teacher, or nurse will be cut. Meanwhile, Vince Cable of the Lib Dems argued that Brown failed to deal with the revaluation of council tax bands, resulting in significant increases for some. The House of Commons authorities have told MPs that their offices will be deep cleaned during the three-week poll campaign.",

The Gameboyzz Orchestra Project uses six Nintendo GameBoys connected through a mixing board to create music, with each member improvising and providing a different sound. The group plays experimental music and aims to be unique by only playing original tracks. They have received both positive and mixed reactions from audiences, and hope to release a CD next year with the help of their sponsor, the Polish distributor of Nintendo products. However, due to the high cost of the GameBoy Advance in Poland, the group does not expect much competition from other musicians anytime soon.",
35,"Work and Pensions Secretary Alan Johnson has cautioned that the Child Support Agency (CSA) could be closed down if it does not improve its services. This would be a ""nuclear option,"" he added. The Commons work and pensions committee called for the agency to be shut down if it fails to improve, and recommended contingency plans, including an option to abandon the new computer system. Johnson did not rule out the possibility of moving to a completely new system, but stressed that this would only happen if the government were convinced that the current system was irremediable. The CSA has been criticized for delays and inaccurate calculations, and a £720 million backlog of outstanding payments from absent parents. The government has suspended its plan to reduce the agency's staff by 25%, following the committee's criticism.",
36,"28 individuals, including a British citizen, have been arrested in a global operation targeting a website accused of identity fraud. The website, Shadowcrew.com, is alleged to be a global centre for criminals engaged in credit card fraud. Operation Firewall, led by the US Secret Service, involved seven countries and resulted in indictments for 19 individuals in Newark, New Jersey. The British teenager was arrested in connection with this operation and released on bail. The authorities estimated that the fraud caused losses of over $4m. The suspects were involved in an internet-based network that stole people's identities and used computers and websites for fraudulent activities. The investigation lasted 15 months and involved 30 law enforcement agencies worldwide. The Shadowcrew website listed several discussion groups, with members using it for organised crime purposes, including trafficking counterfeit credit cards and false identification materials. The website has since been taken over by the Secret Service. Mick Deats, the head of the NHTCU, warned that while the internet offers great benefits, it also has opportunities for criminals seeking to abuse those benefits for criminal gain.",
37,"According to research by Ericsson, phone companies should focus on how handsets fit in with people's lifestyles rather than just promoting better technology. The study found that consumers are more interested in how phones fit with their habits and routines rather than the technical specifications. The research also showed that people tend to use phones in similar ways to other devices for activities like diary-writing but are attracted to the convenience of using their mobiles. Ericsson noted that consumers break down into different groups or ""tribes"" who use phones in different ways, and early adopters tend to drive the adoption of new features, which gradually shape new habits and lifestyles.",

39,"According to local newspaper reports, Algeria has faced violent protests over the weekend due to the government's decision to increase gas prices. There were demonstrations in various regions, causing disruptions such as roadblocks, attacks on public buildings, and destruction of vehicles. This increase in the price of butane gas, an essential fuel for cooking, has led to further resentment in some of the country's poorest regions, where economic conditions are already failing. Earlier, there were demonstrations against the price change, but police had restored order. However, reports suggest that trouble escalated over the weekend, especially in towns close to Bouira, and the Tiaret and Sidi Ammar regions. Plus, the Maghnia region witnessed riots close to the Moroccan border. Algerians residing in remote mountain areas primarily use butane gas and fuel oil to cook and heat their homes.",

This report has provided more details on WMC to trigger a potential rival bid, which may emerge in the next one to two weeks, according to analysts. There is now increasing pressure on Xstrata to increase its offer as a result of this valuation.

Milburn affirmed that the posters were anti-Tory and not anti-Semitic. He acknowledged the concerns of the public and said that he respected their views. The controversy erupted after Labour released posters that seemed to portray Conservative leader Michael Howard, who is Jewish, as Fagin and a flying pig. The Tories accused Labour of a calculated campaign of sly anti-Semitism.  Labour withdrew the controversial posters, and four new designs were launched. The new posters avoided the Fagin and flying pig portrayals but continued to target Howard personally. The new posters were chosen by Labour supporters after the earlier posters were taken off the website.",
42,"The CEO of US TV network Fox, Gail Berman, has acknowledged that the company has relied too much on reality TV shows, including the poorly-rated program Who's Your Daddy. This caused the network's prime-time audience to fall by 600,000 to 5.9 million. Berman recognized that while Fox's audience expects loud content, not all of their reality shows have been successful. Despite the fact that the network had promised to launch new shows every season, the strategy was not well-received. Berman is predicting lower ratings even for Fox's established reality shows, such as American Idol. The network has changed its plan for new show launches, now unveiling them in May instead of June. One of the new shows will be American Dad, an animated series created by Seth MacFarlane, who also created Family Guy.",

44,"IBM puts cash behind Linux push IBM is spending $100m (£52m) over the next three years beefing up its commitment to Linux software. The cash injection will be used to help its customers use Linux on every type of device from handheld computers and phones right up to powerful servers. IBM said the money will fund a variety of technical, research and marketing initiatives to boost Linux use. IBM said it had taken the step in response to greater customer demand for the open source software. In 2004 IBM said it had seen double digit growth in the number of customers using Linux to help staff work together more closely. The money will be used to help this push towards greater collaboration and will add Linux-based elements to IBM's Workplace software. Workplace is a suite of programs and tools that allow workers to get at core business applications no matter what device they use to connect to corporate networks. One of the main focuses of the initiative will be to make it easier to use Linux-based desktop computers and mobile devices with Workplace. Even before IBM announced this latest spending boost it was one of the biggest advocates of the open source way of working. In 2001 it put $300m into a three-year Linux program and has produced Linux versions of many of its programs. Linux and the open source software movement are based on the premise that developers should be free to tinker with the core components of software programs. They reason that more open scrutiny of software produces better programs and fuels innovation.

Valve also revealed that a small number of accounts were closed because people were using stolen credit cards to buy copies of the game. Some who have been banned from the game have protested their innocence, but the move proves the power of the Steam system in combating piracy.

One of the members, Agnetha Fältskog, who has been reclusive since the band disbanded in 1982 also made a public appearance. The musical will be performed in Swedish for the first time and the translation of the musical was overseen by Bjorn Ulvaeus, a former Abba member. The show has become a worldwide phenomenon and has been staged in several countries including the UK and the US, and has been watched by over 20 million people.",
88,"Robots march to US cinema summit Animated movie Robots has opened at the top of the US and Canada box office chart, taking $36.5m (£19m) on its first weekend on release. Featuring the voices of Ewan McGregor, Halle Berry, Robin Williams and Mel Brooks, Robots follows a robot inventor who moves to a big city. Vin Diesel's family comedy The Pacifier fell to the number two spot, taking $18.1m (£9.4m). New Bruce Willis movie Hostage opened at number four with $9.8m (£5.1m). However, a recut version of Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ, which featured less violence than last year's original movie, took just $239,850 (£125,000), despite opening in 957 cinemas. The new version of the film received little publicity and the original version is available across the US on DVD. ""We certainly had higher expectations than what we got,"" said Rob Schwartz, head of distribution for Newmarket Films, which released The Passion of the Christ. ""We were trying to get the film out there, hoping it would reach an audience that it didn't quite reach the first time around. It doesn't seem to have worked out quite as well as we had hoped."" Meanwhile, Will Smith comedy Hitch has become the top film at the global box office after taking an estimated $30.1m (£15.6m) over the weekend at cinemas outside North America, according to industry website Screen Daily. It has taken $65.5m (£34.1m) so far, buoyed by opening at number one in the UK last weekend and a successful run in Germany. The movie, which cost a reported $70m (£36.4m) to make, has taken $138m (£72m) in the US so far.

89,"Technology companies like Sony, Philips, Matsushita, and Samsung are collaborating to develop a common way to prevent digital music and video piracy. They want to create a system that ensures files can only be played on the hardware they produce and prevent illegal copying. However, this move may lead to more confusion for consumers who are already struggling with various content control systems. These systems are known as Digital Rights Management (DRM) and limit what people can do with their downloaded files. The Marlin Joint Development Association is the alliance set up by the four firms to work on this common control system. The system will define basic specifications that every device made by the four companies will conform to. The move is a way for the companies to decide their fate on content control instead of having to rely on Microsoft and Apple. However, this new common system will sit alongside the existing content control systems of rival companies such as Apple and Microsoft, which could cause more confusion. DRM systems are meant to control consumers, and firms use them to maximize profit. There are doubts about the Marlin system's ability to achieve its goal since no DRM system has managed to prevent piracy. DRM systems only control the consumers, so the studios and labels can sell their media again and again to maximize profits.",
90,"The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is taking place in Las Vegas and is showcasing new technologies and gadgets that will be available in the coming year. There will be over 50,000 new products unveiled during the show, including the next generation Xbox, which will be announced in a pre-show keynote speech by Microsoft Chief, Bill Gates. The focus of this year's show will be on technologies that allow people to control their multimedia content and watch it anytime, anywhere. Digital technology in 2004 showed the strongest growth yet in the US, and it is predicted to continue in 2005 with wholesale shipments expected to rise by 11%. The CEA predicts that there will be several key technology trends to watch such as gaming on mobile devices and the increase in hard drive boxes capable of storing thousands of images, video and audio files that can be accessed through other devices within a home network.",

This involves creating new chemical mixtures for batteries and implementing changes in the production of laptop components, as well as reducing the power consumed by displays. Lithium-ion battery technology has already been maximized, so other changes are necessary to achieve the goal of laptops lasting up to eight hours on a single charge. The establishment of the Mobile PC Extended Battery Life (EBL) Working Group has allowed industry players to share information about creating less power-hungry notebooks. Intel's work in testing energy consumption of laptop components has led to improvements in reducing power usage. Efforts are also focused on developing displays that consume less energy.

96,"TV future in the hands of viewers With home theatre systems, plasma high-definition TVs, and digital video recorders moving into the living room, the way people watch TV will be radically different in five years' time. That is according to an expert panel which gathered at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas to discuss how these new technologies will impact one of our favourite pastimes. With the US leading the trend, programmes and other content will be delivered to viewers via home networks, through cable, satellite, telecoms companies, and broadband service providers to front rooms and portable devices. One of the most talked-about technologies of CES has been digital and personal video recorders (DVR and PVR). These set-top boxes, like the US's TiVo and the UK's Sky+ system, allow people to record, store, play, pause and forward wind TV programmes when they want. Essentially, the technology allows for much more personalised TV. They are also being built-in to high-definition TV sets, which are big business in Japan and the US, but slower to take off in Europe because of the lack of high-definition programming. Not only can people forward wind through adverts, they can also forget about abiding by network and channel schedules, putting together their own a-la-carte entertainment. But some US networks and cable and satellite companies are worried about what it means for them in terms of advertising revenues as well as ""brand identity"" and viewer loyalty to channels. Although the US leads in this technology at the moment, it is also a concern that is being raised in Europe, particularly with the growing uptake of services like Sky+. ""What happens here today, we will see in nine months to a years' time in the UK,"" Adam Hume, the BBC Broadcast's futurologist told the BBC News website. For the likes of the BBC, there are no issues of lost advertising revenue yet. It is a more pressing issue at the moment for commercial UK broadcasters, but brand loyalty is important for everyone. ""We will be talking more about content brands rather than network brands,"" said Tim Hanlon, from brand communications firm Starcom MediaVest. ""The reality is that with broadband connections, anybody can be the producer of content."" He added: ""The challenge now is that it is hard to promote a programme with so much choice."" What this means, said Stacey Jolna, senior vice president of TV Guide TV group, is that the way people find the content they want to watch has to be simplified for TV viewers. It means that networks, in US terms, or channels could take a leaf out of Google's book and be the search engine of the future, instead of the scheduler to help people find what they want to watch. This kind of channel model might work for the younger iPod generation which is used to taking control of their gadgets and what they play on them. But it might not suit everyone, the panel recognised. Older generations are more comfortable with familiar schedules and channel brands because they know what they are getting. They perhaps do not want so much of the choice put into their hands, Mr Hanlon suggested. ""On the other end, you have the kids just out of diapers who are pushing buttons already - everything is possible and available to them,"" said Mr Hanlon. ""Ultimately, the consumer will tell the market they want."" Of the 50,000 new gadgets and technologies being showcased at CES, many of them are about enhancing the TV-watching experience. High-definition TV sets are everywhere and many new models of LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) TVs have been launched with DVR capability built into them, instead of being external boxes. One such example launched at the show is Humax's 26-inch LCD TV with an 80-hour TiVo DVR and DVD recorder. One of the US's biggest satellite TV companies, DirectTV, has even launched its own branded DVR at the show with 100-hours of recording capability, instant replay, and a search function. The set can pause and rewind TV for up to 90 hours. And Microsoft chief Bill Gates announced in his pre-show keynote speech a partnership with TiVo, called TiVoToGo, which means people can play recorded programmes on Windows PCs and mobile devices. All these reflect the increasing trend of freeing up multimedia so that people can watch what they want, when they want.

97,"According to recent figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), UK retail sales were better than anticipated in November, with a rise of 0.6% on the month and 6.1% on the year. This positive news for retailers could be attributed to the seasonal increase in Christmas shopping, along with aggressive discounting strategies implemented by brands such as Marks & Spencer. However, recent data from the British Retail Consortium showed a slight slip of 0.2% in High Street sales during November. Despite the uncertainty caused by this mixed data, the report fueled a rally for the sterling and suggests that a further interest rate rise could happen in the New Year.",

The settlement, which includes $5m in fines and more than $4m to fund compliance checks with gun regulation and to prevent the sale of ammunition to minors, was announced after the company suspended firearms sales in California. The lawsuit accused Wal-Mart of selling firearms to people who weren't allowed to own them and delivering guns to customers who bought them for prohibited persons. Although the company has not announced any plans to restart firearms sales in California, Bill Lockyer, California attorney general, stated that the supermarket chain must follow state regulations if it were to do so.",

Sanjaya Senanayake, or Morquendi, was one of the first to use this method, providing ground assessments of needs through text messages that were shared on a blog called Dogs without Borders. Taran Rampersad in Trinidad and Tobago saw the potential for centralizing text messages and redistributing them to aid workers or other people who could help. He, along with Dan Lane and other techies, are creating the Alert Retrieval Cache, an open-source system to link those in need with those who can help. However, creating awareness about the system's availability remains a significant challenge. Rampersad hopes that governments will eventually take notice and support the Alert Retrieval Cache.",

109,"The UK government has proposed a new anti-terrorism bill, which includes the power for the Home Secretary to put suspects under house arrest without trial. The bill has faced opposition from the Conservative, Liberal Democrat and some Labour MPs, who believe judges should be the only ones with the power to order detention of UK citizens. The bill proposes ""control orders"", which would allow for house arrest in extreme cases, as well as curfews and limits on phone and internet access for other suspects. The opposition parties are concerned that the home secretary would have too much power, rather than granting judges more responsibility. The current laws, which detain foreign terror suspects, have been ruled to break human rights rules, and the new bill plans to replace them. The controversy surrounding the bill is whether politicians should have the power to detain UK citizens without trial or whether it takes away their civil liberties. Although the government is expected to win the vote in the House of Commons, they will face strong opposition in the House of Lords.",

Aiming to both stir economic growth and aid the country's poor, finance minister Trevor Manuel said the focus of the 2005 budget was ""more for all"". The tax cuts target firms and individuals, cutting corporate tax from 30% to 29% and offering income tax cuts worth 6.8bn rand ($1.2bn; £910m). Spending on health and education will rise by 9.4% and 8.1% respectively. Spending on housing and sanitation will rise by 12%. All the spending increases will run over the next three years. Unveiling the 418bn-rand budget to parliament, Mr Manuel said the South African economy had grown by an average of 3.2% over the past four years, slightly below the African average of 4%. He predicted that the South African economy would grow by 4.3% in 2005 and 4.2% in 2006. Mr Manuel added that inflation fell to 4.3% in 2004 and is expected to remain at between 3% and 6% from now until at least 2008, helped by interest rates which are at their lowest level in 24 years. Given that both corporate and personal taxes are being cut - under the new measures, those earning less than 35,000 rand a year will be exempt from income tax - the extra 22.3bn rand in social spending will be partly met by higher fuel, tobacco and alcohol taxes. ""In this budget, the focus is on more for all, not more for some, and not a hell of a lot more for a few, but spread across all of South Africa,"" said Mr Manuel. He said that the economic situation was a ""marked improvement"" on the position at the end of apartheid, but acknowledged that more needed to be done to improve the lives and livelihoods of the disadvantaged. About 280,000 jobs a year have been created in South Africa since 2000 but unemployment remains high, currently close to 30%. Economist Colen Garrow said the budget looked as if it would stimulate economic growth. ""It's pleasant to see the cut in company taxes, it's a good incentive for business,"" he said.

Technorati, a blog search engine, tracks about six million blogs and says that more than 12,000 are added daily. A blog is created every 5.8 seconds, according to US research think-tank Pew Internet and American Life, but less than 40% of the total are updated at least once every two months. Nikolai Nolan, who has run the Bloggies for the past five years, told the BBC News website he was not too surprised by the amount of voters who crowded the site. ""The awards always get a lot of traffic; this was just my first year on a server with a bandwidth limit, so I had to guess how much I'd need,"" he said. There were many new finalists this year, he added, and a few that had won Bloggies before. Several entries reflected specific news events. ""There are four nominations for the South-East Asia Earthquake and Tsunami Blog, which is a pretty timely one for 2005,"" said Mr Nolan. The big Bloggies battle will be for the ultimate prize of blog of the year. The nominated blogs are wide-ranging covering what is in the news to quirky sites of interest. Fighting it out for the coveted award are Gawker, This Fish Needs a Bicycle, Wonkette, Boing Boing, and Gothamist. In a sign that blogs are playing an increasingly key part in spreading news and current affairs, The South-East Asia Earthquake and Tsunami Blog is also nominated in the best overall category. GreenFairyDotcom, Londonist, Hicksdesign, PlasticBag and London Underground Tube Blog are the nominees in the best British or Irish weblog. Included in the other categories is best ""meme"". This is for the top ""replicating idea that spread about weblogs"". Nominations include Flickr, a web photo album which lets people upload, tag, share and publish their images to blogs. Podcasting has also made an appearance in the category. It is an increasingly popular idea that makes use of RSS (really simple syndication) and audio technology to let people easily make their own radio shows, and distribute them automatically onto portable devices. Many are done by those who already have text-based blogs, so they are almost like audio blogs. Three new categories have been added to the list this year, including best food, best entertainment, and best writing of a weblog. One of the categories that was scrapped though was best music blog. The winners of the fifth annual Bloggies are chosen by the public. Public voting closes on 3 February and the winners will be announced sometime between 13 and 15 March.

He suffered two tears to the adductor muscle and was unable to play in the mixed doubles. The doctor who treated him believes that it is unlikely he will recover in time for the Open. Although Philippoussis is holding out hope that he can still compete, the injury is serious and he will need time to strengthen his muscles before he can handle the demands of competitive tennis. Another player, Tommy Haas, is also in doubt for the tournament due to a thigh injury he sustained during the same tournament.",
127,"The popularity of broadband internet access increased significantly in 2004, with many people signing up due to falling prices and increased marketing. Experts predict that by the end of the next year, over 30% of homes will have broadband access. Local loop unbundling, which would allow competitors to offer faster internet services, became cheaper and more accessible in the UK due to a significant price drop announced by BT. With more than 95% of the population now having broadband access, there are faster broadband options available from cable providers. Nevertheless, understanding broadband plans and deals remains complex for consumers, and broadband is an important technology worth using due to its speed and additional features.",

While there was little coverage of the racist chanting, there was criticism of the English media for stoking up the issue. AS notes the English reaction to Spain coach Luis Aragones' pre-match comments, while Marca focuses on Aragones' praise for his players after the match. Meanwhile, Spain's first-half performance and Xavi's skills were praised, with AS stating that ""Spanish football players played better football than the English"". Rooney was seen as the worst example of England's poor behaviour, with Gary Neville and Ashley Cole also criticised.",

130,"The Welsh Health Minister, Jane Hutt, has announced new waiting time targets for hospitals in Wales. The aim is that no patient will wait more than 12 months for an outpatient appointment by March 2006, down from the current target of 18 months, while the target for an inpatient appointment will remain at 12 months for March 2006. Monthly waiting figures have shown a reduction in waiting times. The announcement came as £264m for health services was allocated to reduce waiting times, improve key areas, and modernise staff pay structures in Wales. While the targets have been welcomed, there are concerns that Wales still lags behind England, and that capacity needs to be built into the system with sustained investment to ensure that Welsh patients do not receive a worse service than patients over the border.",
131,"Jonathan Sayeed, a Conservative MP, has announced his resignation due to health reasons after surviving an attempt to remove him from his position over allegations that he profited from private tours of Parliament. The MP denied the accusation of being paid to guide visitors around the Palace of Westminster, but was suspended from Parliament for two weeks and had the whip withdrawn for one month. Despite winning the vote to deselect him from his constituency association, Sayeed has now resigned from his role. The allegation was made by the Sunday Times, claiming that English Manner Limited charged clients for access to Westminster through Sayeed. The Standards and Privileges Committee launched an inquiry, and although Sayeed apologized for his conduct and denied the claims, he insisted that the committee's report had contained some factual errors. Sayeed had been an MP since 1997 for Mid-Bedfordshire, having previously represented Bristol East from 1983 to 1992.",
132,"According to a report by the government's finance watchdog, a number of errors contributed to the failure of the first attempt to sell the Millennium Dome after the close of the Millennium exhibition. The report cited a confusion of decision-makers involved in the sale, which cost £28.7m to maintain and sell over four years. However, a later sale to turn the Dome into a sport and entertainment venue was successful and could return over £550m to the public sector. While some officials praised the deal, others cautioned the government to ensure taxpayers get the full benefit of the sale. The previous attempt to sell the Dome was seen as a failure due to a confused and muddled process, but the successful sale was attributed to the hard work of government officials.",

The UK housing market has recently shown signs of slowing down following interest rate hikes, and economists predict a drop in prices in 2005. However, annual house price inflation remains strong, having increased by 13.8% in the year to November. The ODPM figures are viewed as somewhat of a lagging indicator by economists, who believe the annual house price growth will weaken in the coming months. The ODPM attributed the monthly fall in prices to a decrease in the value of detached houses and flats.",

The directors are expected to deny any wrongdoing by settling the case to remove uncertainties and costs of further litigation. Two other outside former directors remain defendants in the lawsuit, and former CEO Bernard Ebbers is facing criminal charges for overseeing the fraud.",
138,"Multi-purpose TV aids India Two-thirds of the world's population, 4 billion people, live on $2,000 a year or less. You might think that the last thing on their minds would be getting a television set or a computer. But that's not the case. Many people in the developing world give up one of their daily meals so they can afford to buy a TV. And now, an Indian-born computer engineer thinks he's come up with a way to give them cheap access to the internet. Carnegie Mellon Professor Raj Reddy has spent the bulk of his professional career trying to find ways to make technology accessible to poor people. The first step is to figure out why poor people would want a personal computer and Professor Reddy thinks he has a pretty good idea of why they might. ""I come from a village,"" says Prof Reddy, ""I know what the population is like, many of them are illiterate, and many of them have other concerns."" ""There, nobody will use it for the conventional uses of a PC, word processing and Powerpoint,"" he said. ""So it's clear to me that if people wanted to use PCs in a village - it has to usable by illiterate people and it must be primarily for entertainment, education, telemedicine, and access to expert advice."" Prof Reddy also thinks that tying it into some kind of aid package was the wrong approach. After all, he asked -- what aid group could possibly give expensive computers to 250 million less fortunate Indians, let alone the billions of poor people around the world? Instead, Prof Reddy decided to think of those 250 million Indians as a potential market. The problem then becomes one of making the product compelling enough. ""It must be so compelling that you would give up your third meal in order to have this,"" Prof Reddy says. ""People do this today with television sets. If you go to India, and many other countries, they will first go get a television set before they worry about one more meal. Why? Because personalized entertainment has become very important."" This hatched a completely new idea. He calls it a PCtvt - A personal computer, television and telephone all in one that runs on a normal desktop machine. Literate users can surf through the applications with a keyboard and mouse but illiterate users can use what looks like a television remote control. On the screen, pictures - not words - designate applications like TV, voice mail, and video e-mail. This dependence on graphics, video and audio means that a computer for an illiterate person needs 100 times more power and more memory than one for a PhD. Prassana Rambathla, one of Prof Reddy's graduate students, says that ""when you're talking illiterate you're talking audio and video, and that demands exponentially high bandwidth.' ""It can't choke at any point in time, and it has to withstand anything no matter what you're pressing."" ""The major part is making it foolproof, very tough, so that it never breaks,"" he says. The Carnegie Mellon team says this project is only possible because PCs are now so much cheaper and have built-in audio and video hardware and software. Limited trials of the PCtvt are due to start this month in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. Although Andhra Pradesh has a fairly good infrastructure but work has to be done to ensure reliable connections to the net. Prof Reddy has teamed up with Eric Brewer at the University of California at Berkeley. The answer, says Prof Brewer, is wi-fi. ""We're looking at the thing you'll see in Starbuck's or many other hotspots,"" he says. ""We're doing a lot of work on long-distance wireless and how to make the network work better in the presence of intermittency, when the power goes up and down, and the links go up and down, and the computers you're connected to just get turned off for no reason."" Prof Reddy says he hopes to lease the PCtvts for about $10 a month, and thinks Indians will rent the units for the television and DVD capabilities. Reddy says he can then introduce the PCtvt's other technologies - such as video mail. For example, a farmer could use the PCtvt's webcam to send a picture of a harmful insect to a local official who could send back a proposed course of action to the farmer. Prof Reddy thinks this kind of communication is the real pay-off. ""The underlying problem,"" he says, ""is how you can increase their wealth and reduce their poverty and reduce their illiteracy, and improve their health care.' ""And what I'm postulating is that this is the technology that will enable them. If I didn't have it, it would be an uphill battle. Even with the technology it's an uphill battle. But I have a tool. There is hope. I can reach them in ways that have not been possible before."" Clark Boyd is technology correspondent for The World, a BBC World Service and WGBH-Boston co-production

139,"The real danger with online data is not what happens during transmission, but what happens when it reaches its destination. Criminals may be applying for jobs in financial institutions to gain access to customers' confidential data, which is valuable for identity theft. Even if people take precautions with their personal information, if trusted organizations are not capable of securing their databases, people are still at risk of identity theft. Companies like SecureWave offer solutions to restrict the use of USB ports to prevent data theft, but the issue of poor system security remains. The Data Protection Act is in place to prevent unauthorized disclosure of personal data, but penalties are small and the process of prosecuting under the Act is convoluted. Therefore, a more stringent data protection law or civil lawsuits against financial institutions may be necessary to pressure them to improve their security processes.",
140,"IBM frees 500 software patents Computer giant IBM says 500 of its software patents will be released into the open development community. The move means developers will be able to use the technologies without paying for a licence from the company. IBM described the step as a ""new era"" in how it dealt with intellectual property and promised further patents would be made freely available. The patents include software for a range of practices, including text recognition and database management. Traditional technology business policy is to amass patents and despite IBM's announcement the company continues to follow this route. IBM was granted 3,248 patents in 2004, more than any other firm in the US, the New York Times reports. For each of the past 12 years IBM has been granted more US patents than any other company. IBM has received 25,772 US patents in that period and reportedly has more than 40,000 current patents. In a statement, Dr John E. Kelly, IBM senior vice president, Technology and Intellectual Property, said: ""True innovation leadership is about more than just the numbers of patents granted. It's about innovating to benefit customers, partners and society. ""Our pledge today is the beginning of a new era in how IBM will manage intellectual property."" In the past, IBM has supported the non-commercial operating system Linux although critics have said this was done only as an attempt to undermine Microsoft. The company said it wanted to encourage other firms to release patents into what it called a ""patent commons"". Adam Jollans, IBM's world-wide Linux strategy manager, said the move was a genuine attempt to encourage innovation. ""We believe that releasing these patents will result in innovation moving more quickly. ""This is about encouraging collaboration and following a model much like academia."" Mr Jollans likened the plan for a patent commons to the way the internet was developed and said everyone could take advantage of the result of collaboration. ""The internet's impact has been on everyone. The benefits are there for everyone to take advantage of."" Stuart Cohen, chief executive of US firm Open Source Development Labs, said the move could mean a change in the way companies deal with patents. ""I think other companies will follow suit,"" he said. But not everyone was as supportive. Florian Mueller, campaign manager of a group lobbying toprevent software patents becoming legal in the European Union,dismissed IBM's move as insubstantial. ""It's just diversionary tactics,"" wrote Mr Mueller, who leadsnosoftwarepatents.com, in a message on the group's website. ""Let's put this into perspective: We're talking aboutroughly one percent of IBM's worldwide patent portfolio. They filethat number of patents in about a month's time,"" he added. IBM will continue to hold the 500 patents but it has pledged to seek no royalties from the patents. The company said it would not place any restrictions on companies, groups or individuals who use them in open-source projects. Open source software is developed by programmers who offer the source code - the origins of the program - for free and allow others to adapt or improve the software. End users have the right to modify and redistribute the software, as well as the right to package and sell the software. Other areas covered by the patents released by IBM include storage management, simultaneous multiprocessing, image processing, networking and e-commerce.

Although the details of the company's investment were not disclosed, the new plant is expected to produce 150,000 cars yearly, aiming to increase Hyundai's annual production capacity to 400,000 units, compared to being the country's second-largest car manufacturer. The company anticipates an increase in sales by 16% to 250,000 in India by 2005, with expectations to double the sales to 400,000 by 2010. The new plant will be erected beside the existing one in Chennai, located in the southern province of Tamil Nadu. Hyundai predicts a 15% growth in the Indian automotive market this year, which should reach 920,000 vehicles, expecting to attain 1.6 million vehicles by 2010. Demand for cars in India has been caused by the low level of car ownership and the poor state of public transport, with only eight people per thousand possessing an automobile. Plans are in motion to use India as a foundation for exporting products to Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East. The chairman, Chung Mong-koo, commented that expanding production is crucial for meeting the growing Indian auto market, which grows over 12% yearly, to surpass their competitors. The purpose is for Hyundai to become a global top five auto maker by 2010, controlling half of South Korea's market.",

Jarvis previously warned that it could go bankrupt if it did not secure a refinancing deal by January 2005, but now they have agreed with their banks to extend their credit facilities until March 2006. The company plans on scaling back its construction division and focuses on UK rail renewal, road repair, and plant hire work. The sale is beneficial for Ferrovial since they already have a 33% stake in Tube Lines and have been interested in acquiring more UK infrastructure assets.

The party eventually removed the image from its website, replacing it with an alternative idea. A new poster featuring Mr Howard and Oliver Letwin with a blackboard showing 2+2=5 has been proposed. The previous poster has been compared to the portrayal of Fagin from the musical Oliver!, and another poster showing Mr Howard and Mr Letwin as flying pigs also drew controversy. Jewish Chronicle editor Ned Temko stated that the hypnotism image raised deeper concerns, bearing links with centuries-old prejudice.

Oxfam emphasizes that global poverty is an obligation and matter of justice, not just an act of charity. In 1970, G8 members agreed to allocate 0.7% of their incomes to aid; however, 34 years later, none of the members have reached this goal, and many have not set a timetable to do so. The report goes on to state the negative consequences of not investing in poor countries' sustainable development, saying that global poverty threatens global prosperity and security. Blair and Chancellor Gordon Brown have both called for urgent action to fight world poverty, and Blair has listed it as one of his G8 priorities alongside climate change and the AIDS epidemic. Brown pledged to forgive Britain's debts owed by poor nations, and the government is committed to reaching 0.7% of gross national income for overseas development aid by 2013. An International Finance Facility, if enacted, would allow the 0.7% goal to be achieved earlier, by 2008-09.

Despite the station's aim not to replace John Peel, but keep his legacy alive, critics doubt that the new DJs can fill in Peel's shoes. The DJs were chosen for their diverse musical expertise. The OneMusic show will play non-commercial and unpredictable tracks. Sara Cox will also return after taking maternity leave to host the lunchtime show on Saturdays. Some people suggested that the BBC should source new talent from internet radio stations like totallyradio.com, where Claire Kember is compared to the legendary John Peel by listeners.",

160,"Security firm warns that Windows-operated ATM networks may be more vulnerable to computer viruses, as many banks are adopting this operating system for cash machines. There have been four reported incidents of Windows viruses disrupting the networks of cash machines, but some experts argue that these risks are being overstated. IBM's OS/2 operating system, which has long been used to power cash machines around the world, will soon no longer be supported, forcing banks to seek alternatives. Additionally, the move to Windows is being driven by other factors, such as the demand for upgraded cash machines to use Europay, MasterCard, and Visa's credit cards with computer chips, as well as US laws requiring equal access for disabled individuals. Anti-virus firm Trend Micro warns that the risks of using Windows cash machines are not negligible, with research showing that 70% of new cash machines run on Windows. Previous cyberattacks against Windows ATMs have caused cash machines to be unavailable for hours. However, since cash machines have a relatively long operating lifetime of up to a decade, the actual number of machines at risk may be limited, and banks may simply upgrade to new models as part of their usual replacement cycle. Some experts note that cash machines have built-in security systems to prevent spontaneous dispensing of cash, and that banks' main concerns are disruption of their internal networks and customer inconvenience. The Association of Payment and Clearing Services in the UK downplays the risk from viruses, stating that the country's tightly-knit community of cash machine operators and data network providers makes the threat minimal.",

170,"The use of online games in politics gained momentum in 2004, with the US presidential election becoming a platform to reach out to a generation of players. The increasing prevalence of video games in culture and society was noted by experts. The Iowa Game, commissioned by Howard Dean, was the first official political campaign game, followed by more than 20 others. Artists and designers are using this form of gaming to make social commentary. Games are a powerful tool for interaction and modelling real situations in an original way. Players can learn about the world and themselves through gaming.

Ms Cooper also mentioned that councils are not identifying enough appropriate locations to establish such sites and are lacking the necessary powers to deal with illegal developments. New regulations will allow officials to serve ""temporary stop notices"" to prevent development on a site that does not have full legal consent. There has been resistance from some councils to provide sites for travellers, which has led to costly evictions and increased tensions.

204,"There are concerns that the Tomlinson report's proposal for a new four-tier diploma to replace existing qualifications for secondary schools in England may be rejected by the government's upcoming response, which is expected next week. Some worry that GCSEs and A-levels may remain in place despite the proposed changes. There are appeals for the government not to compromise on the proposed reforms and to tackle the structural issues in the country's secondary education system. The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority has advised against partial implementation of the changes, as it may compromise the integrity of the whole diploma. The Tomlinson proposals have received support from multiple sources, including universities and head teachers, but have faced criticism from some, such as the CBI and former chief schools inspector Professor Chris Woodhead. The Conservative Party has proposed an alternative plan to revert to a system where only the top percentage of students each year receive top A-level grades.",
205,"Jack Straw, the foreign secretary, has criticised the decision made by the highest court in Britain that detaining foreign terrorist suspects without trial is a violation of human rights. Straw argued that the government has a duty to protect individuals from terrorism and that the right to life is the most important liberty. He rejected the claim that the detainees were being held arbitrarily and believed that the law lords were incorrect in their ruling. The government's anti-terror policy has been dealt a significant blow by the House of Lords who ruled in favour of appeals made by the men who were being detained. However, Straw maintained that this issue did not constitute a constitutional crisis and that the law lords' ruling did not imply that the detainees were being held on the whim of the home secretary. The new home secretary, Charles Clarke, also defended the decision to keep the nine men in prison while the law was being reviewed. The detainees in question cannot be deported if this would result in persecution in their homeland. The government had opted out of part of the European Convention on Human Rights regarding the right to a fair trial to enact anti-terrorism legislation in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. The detainees took their case to the House of Lords after the Court of Appeal had supported the Home Office's power to hold them without charge or limit. The ruling by the law lords was deemed a constitutional matter and was heard by a panel of nine judges. One of the detainees spoke out and said that he hoped the government would act on the decision made and release him along with others who were being detained.",

The chairman of the theater, David Johnston, has mentioned that the only solution is to rebuild the theater at a cost of £8m. To raise money, Neeson has invited successful Irish Americans to the event, stating that the Lyric is too significant to the cultural and social life of Northern Ireland to crumble and fall apart. The Lyric Theatre has been in operation for 50 years, and Neeson claims it is where he began his career. His goal was to use the event to help rebuild the theater and restore its former glory. Despite Belfast's challenging circumstances, the theater shone like a ray of light and hope six nights a week, showcasing a variety of productions from Shakespeare to O'Casey. The Lyric Theatre was where actors like Neeson, playwrights like Martin Lynch and Gary Mitchell, alongside Adrian Dunbar and Stephen Rea, began their careers.

The rejection was unanimous among politicians, meaning the bill will have to go through another round of consultation to have a chance of becoming law.

213,"New EU regulations have increased the compensation that air passengers are entitled to if they are unable to board their flight due to overbooking, cancellations, or flight delays. Depending on the length of the flight, compensation ranges from €250 to €600 and applies to scheduled and charter flights, including budget airlines. Airlines have criticized the legislation, fearing it may force them to push prices higher to cover the extra expense. The EU implemented these changes to deter airlines from overbooking flights in order to increase passenger compensation. Passengers are now entitled to compensation if they are involuntarily moved to a later flight, and airlines must compensate all passengers if a flight is cancelled or delayed for more than two hours due to the airline's fault. However, compensation is not required for ""extraordinary circumstances"" such as bad weather or strikes. Low-cost airlines have criticized the new compensation levels, and the airlines and consumers were not consulted over the changes, according to The European Regions Airline Association (ERAA). The new compensation regime became effective on Thursday, and in cases of dispute, national enforcement bodies will decide if a passenger has a case.",

217,"MPs have criticized the current child access system, stating that divorced parents seeking access to their children are often at a disadvantage due to delays in the legal system. The Constitutional Affairs Select Committee suggests that courts should only be used as a last resort, but when they are used, their orders should be more strictly enforced. Campaign groups have suggested a legal presumption of equal access, but the MPs rejected this, stating that the interests of the child should be paramount, and each case should be considered individually. The MPs suggest that the law should change to require family courts to consider the importance of sustaining the relationship between the child and the non-resident parent. They believe that delays and ineffective court orders allow a new ""status quo"" to be established, where non-resident parents are frequently disadvantaged. The MP's solution is for fewer cases to be dealt with by the courts and for mediation and negotiation to be used instead.",

Ms. Jamieson praised Celtic and Rangers for working towards addressing the problem. However, she said that stopping sectarian abuse associated with Old Firm matches is a key priority for the executive. The issue has become a significant target for the authorities due to its association with violence and tension. A summit will be held next month, which will include senior police officers, church leaders, officials from the clubs, and local authority chiefs, among those to be invited. Ms. Jamieson plans to put pressure on the bigots by imposing banning orders that will hit them the hardest by preventing them from attending matches. She emphasised that sectarianism is not limited to football, but it can act as a triggering point for violence. The clubs, police and supporter groups will work with the authorities to tackle the issue.

Those without settled status, such as asylum seekers awaiting a decision on their application, cannot marry in the UK. Applicants who are subject to immigration controls must register their intention to marry at one of 76 specially designated register offices.

231,"The British Parliament's home affairs committee has issued a report opposing automatic reduction of murder sentences just for pleading guilty. The committee has also called for tougher sentencing for crimes committed under the influence of drugs or alcohol and that being under the influence should be seen as an aggravating factor rather than an excuse. Presently judges can reduce the minimum term that a defendant must serve in a life sentence case if they plead guilty. However, the committee believes that murderers should not receive this benefit, which would serve as an addition to reductions for other mitigating circumstances. Sentences of murderers who plead guilty were further reduced by Lord Woolf’s Sentencing Guidelines Council (SGC), which suggested a one-third discount off sentences for early guilty pleas. The committee urged the senior judge in England and Wales, Lord Woolf, to reconsider his plans regarding reduction in sentence for a guilty plea. In addition, it criticised Home Secretary David Blunkett for introducing last-minute rules allowing reduced sentences for murderers who pleaded guilty.

Yukos has claimed that the sale of Yugansk was illegal and invoiced its complaint in a Houston court. The judge dismissed the case, stating that Yukos did not have a strong enough US presence to establish jurisdiction in the US. Former Yukos boss, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, began his fraud and tax evasion trial whilst in jail for over a year. Yukos had sought help in the US as other courts were unfavourable. Rosneft, a state-controlled oil company, bought Yugansk to help pay off unpaid taxes amounting to $27.5 billion.

In contrast, the FSA only gives guidance on managing conflicts of interest and requires brokers to disclose their commissions only if customers ask.

While the games try to create an immersive and atmospheric experience, their linear plotting and staged moments can sometimes make the gameplay feel stilted. The gameplay can be challenging, but may also be frustrating due to unconvincing collision-detection and infrequent checkpoints.

The court proceedings heard that Deutsche Bank, which was itself being sued by Yukos, had evidence that the documents were backdated to make the case more substantial. This evidence came on the first day of a two-day hearing in Houston. Yukos had maintained that it had transferred $27m into two Texas bank accounts which had been opened by its new US subsidiary in an attempt to strengthen its case in US courts. However, Deutsche Bank argued that the documents were drawn up weeks after the bankruptcy application was made and were backdated.

267,"Former programmer and technology analyst, Bill Thompson warns that a new European directive may put software developers at risk of legal action. The Dutch government proposes to push through a controversial measure that lacks majority support from national governments and has been rejected by the European Parliament. The patenting of computer programs is the topic at issue, and if passed, this directive will allow programs to be patented in Europe, as they are in the US. Thompson argues that this will have disastrous results for small companies, programmers, and the free and open source software movement, as large companies will be able to patent all sorts of ideas, limiting their competitors' use of obvious ideas. Once software patents are granted, any programmer may be at risk of infringing on someone else's patent, which will eventually result in lawsuits for small companies and open source products. The directive will limit innovation and damage Europe's computer industry. Despite some national governments' opposition, the new directive is likely to pass. However, opponents are hoping that the Council of Ministers will reject the law.",

The law seeks to offer patent protection to computer-implemented inventions. If the European Council approves the directive, it will move to the European Parliament for another reading, but this does not guarantee it will become law, leading to further delays and controversy. The patenting of computer programs in the US is legal, and critics worry Europe will follow suit, as small companies may not be able to handle legal action to protect their own products.

Despite recent issues such as the heavy tax bills and asset seizures imposed on companies like oil giant Yukos, S&P sees the solidity of government finances as outweighing any risk. Russia is now a net creditor and its gold and foreign currency reserves surpass its foreign public debt. While the other two major ratings agencies had already upgraded Russia's sovereign debt, S&P had held back due to concerns about economic and legal reforms. However, with the government's coffers full from tax revenues from energy sales, S&P now sees the government's own debt as a good investment.
